        <li>Playing the Flute</li>
        <p>I began playing the flute in fifth grade and has since developed his skills 
            across both traditional and Indigenous styles. Music has become a meaningful
             form of self-expression for him, allowing creativity, focus, and cultural 
             appreciation to come together through performance.</p>

        <li>Going to the Gym</li>
        <p>What started as a personal effort to lose weight has evolved into a dedicated
             pursuit of strength and self-improvement. Darsh values the discipline and
              determination that come from consistent training, finding motivation in 
              setting and surpassing new goals.</p>
        <li>Playing Sports</li>
        <p>Darsh has always loved staying active through sports, especially soccer and
             volleyball. These activities allow him to combine teamwork, strategy, and
              competition while maintaining a healthy, energetic lifestyle.</p>
        <li>Hanging Out with Friends</li>
        <p>In his free time, Darsh enjoys spending time with friends—often walking around, 
            grabbing coffee, or playing basketball together. These moments give him balance,
             relaxation, and a chance to connect with others outside of academic and professional
              commitments.</li>
        <p>Darsh has a lifelong interest in building and problem-solving, whether through 
            Legos, mechanical projects, or puzzles. He enjoys the creativity and precision 
            involved in constructing things by hand, which reflects his curiosity and innovative
             mindset.</p>
