        <li>Playing the Flute</li>
        <p>I began playing the flute in fifth grade and have since developed skills

            mastering my skills<p>

        <li>Going to the Gym</li>
        <p>I started going to the gym to lose weight, but once I reached my goal, I began to go to the gym
            to build muscle. I now love to go to the gym, and try not to skip
        </p>
        <li>Playing Sports</li>
        <p>I always love playing outside and still do, playing volleyball and other sports from time to time. I started playing
            sports from a young age, starting with soccer and taekwondo. From there I have diversified the sports I play.

        <li>Hanging Out with Friends</li>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends. We just walk around, 
            eat some food, or play a sport. I hangout with my friends almost every week
        and try to make the most out of every hangout.</li>
        <li>Puzzles</li>
        <p>I always loved solving puzzles, whether it be building stuff, an actual puzzle,
            or even riddles. I always loved challenging myself so that I can get better.
