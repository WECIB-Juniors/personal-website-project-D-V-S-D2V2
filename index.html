            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is <strong>Darsh Pratap Singh</strong>, my email is <em>dvps010@gmail.com</em>, and my Instagram is <em>king.d.v.s</em>. I am 17 years old and currently attend Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnology. I was born on October 23, 2008, in India. I lived in Ohio for most of my life before moving to North Carolina in 8th grade.</p>

            <p>After moving, I attended West Cary Middle School, where I applied to an early college program and was accepted. I chose to enroll at Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnology instead of my base school, Apex Friendship High School, to take advantage of the unique opportunities it offers in technology and biotechnology.</p>

            <p>In my freshman year of high school, I earned my PCAP certification, and during my sophomore year, I achieved my CCST certification. So far in my junior year, I am continuing to build on my skills and explore new academic and personal goals.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h4>Peak Play</h4>
                <p>I helped design and develop a mobile application that encourages users to lose weight through sports-based activities and community engagement. I contributed to the planning and functionality of the app, ensuring it was both motivational and user-friendly. This project reflects my passion for using technology to promote healthier lifestyles and my ability to collaborate effectively within a development team, as I too went through a weight loss journey.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h4>Python Tic-Tac-Toe game</h4>
                <p>I independently coded a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, implementing features such as player input validation, win detection, and replay functionality. This project strengthened my programming and problem-solving skills while reinforcing my understanding of logic structures and algorithm design.</p>
