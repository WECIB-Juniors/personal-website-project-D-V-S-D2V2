    <p>My name is <strong>Darsh Pratap Singh</strong>, my email is <em>dvps010@gmail.com</em>, and my instagram is <em>king.d.v.s</em></p>
    <p>
    I am 17 years old and currently attend Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnology. I was born on October 23, 2008, in India. 
    I lived in Ohio for most of my life before moving to North Carolina in 8th grade.
</p>

<p>
    After moving, I attended West Cary Middle School, where I applied to an early college program and was accepted. 
    I chose to enroll at Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnology instead of my base school, Apex Friendship High School, 
    to take advantage of the unique opportunities it offers in technology and biotechnology.
</p>

<p>
    In my freshman year of high school, I earned my PCAP certification, and during my sophomore year, I achieved my CCST certification. 
    So far in my junior year, I am continuing to build on my skills and explore new academic and personal goals.

    <P>Some projects that I am proud of:</P>
    <ul>
        <li>Peak Play</li>
        <p>I helped design and develop a mobile application that encourages users 
            to lose weight through sports-based activities and community engagement. 
            I contributed to the planning and functionality of the app, ensuring it was
             both motivational and user-friendly. This project reflects my passion for
              using technology to promote healthier lifestyles and his ability to collaborate
               effectively within a development team, as I too went throuhg a weight loss journey.</p>
        <li>Python Tic-Tac-Toe game</li>
        <p>I independently coded a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, 
            implementing features such as player input validation, win detection, and 
            replay functionality. This project strengthened my programming and problem-solving 
            skills while reinforcing my understanding of logic structures and algorithm design.
            I completed this project as my final project for python 1.</p>
        <li>Environmental Science Minecraft Project</li>
        <p>Combining creativity with environmental awareness, I designed an interactive 
            ecosystem within Minecraft along side Aryan to demonstrate concepts like renewable energy, sustainable
             farming, and biodiversity. This project was done as my final project for enviormental science.</p>
